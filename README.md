# SpaceAR

## 💡 Inspiration

We all love to explore the universe. But we also love to explore the universe in a different way. Think about it. If you can see the whole solar system infront of you and you can see the planets and moons, you can see the stars. SpaceAR is here for you to explore the universe in a different way. SpaceAR is a web app that allows you to explore the universe, Mars and space shuttle in a different way with the help of Augmented Reality.

## 💻 What it does

## 🔐 MLH- Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We have implemented a decentralized chat using Hedera. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utiltizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## ⛅ MLH- Best Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for user authentication. Firebase is a free service and easy to use. It is a cloud based service that allows you to store and retrieve data in real time.

## 🌐 MLH- Best Domain Name from Domain.com

- Any domain name with .tech, eg longitude.tech . We will choose the best domain name among all.
